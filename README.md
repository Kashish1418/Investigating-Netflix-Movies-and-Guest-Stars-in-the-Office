# 📺 Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
In the Investigating Netflix Movies And Guest Stars In The Office Project, I used Data Manipulation and data Visualization to solve the real-world data science problem. I performed Deep Exploratory Data Analysis and drawn conclusions from detailed Graphs.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to explore Netflix movie data with a focus on understanding patterns in movie releases and analyzing appearances of guest stars in The Office. This project showcases data manipulation, visualization, and storytelling using Python libraries.

**Finding the Solution of the following question, by using Exploratory Data Analysis:**
1. What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration.
2. A movie is considered short if it's less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save the integer as short_movie_count.

## Netflix
I worked on a data analysis project using Netflix data, focusing specifically on movies released during the 1990s. Originally starting as a DVD rental service in 1997, Netflix has grown into one of the largest entertainment and media platforms. With the vast amount of movies and series available, I saw this as a great opportunity to apply my exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills.

**Netflix Dataset (CSV file)** :
As part of a fictional production company interested in nostalgic content, I analyzed the dataset netflix_data.csv to uncover trends and patterns in 90s cinema. This included examining key metrics such as release year, genres, and other insights to better understand that iconic decade of movies. I also explored the dataset beyond the initial scope to gain deeper insights into the entertainment industry.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas – for data manipulation
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook – for interactive coding and storytelling

## 📊 Key Insights
- Analyzed the distribution of Netflix movies across decades, especially the 1990s.
- Visualized the genre distribution of 90s movies.
- Investigated appearances of famous guest stars in The Office using data slicing and grouping.

## 🖼️ Visualizations & Insights
Here are some key visualizations from the project that helped drive insights:
