# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-the-Office
In the Investigating Netflix Movies And Guest Stars In The Office Project, I used Data Manipulation and data Visualization to solve the real-world data science problem. I performed Deep Exploratory Data Analysis and drawn conclusions from detailed Graphs.

## Netflix
I worked on a data analysis project using Netflix data, focusing specifically on movies released during the 1990s. Originally starting as a DVD rental service in 1997, Netflix has grown into one of the largest entertainment and media platforms. With the vast amount of movies and series available, I saw this as a great opportunity to apply my exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills.

## Netflix Dataset (CSV file)
As part of a fictional production company interested in nostalgic content, I analyzed the dataset netflix_data.csv to uncover trends and patterns in 90s cinema. This included examining key metrics such as release year, genres, and other insights to better understand that iconic decade of movies. I also explored the dataset beyond the initial scope to gain deeper insights into the entertainment industry.
